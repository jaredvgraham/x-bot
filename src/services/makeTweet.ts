Your goal is to write a tweet that strongly resonates with one side of the political or social spectrum while provoking the opposite side. Use styles like "${styles.join(
      ", "
    )}" to sharpen your tone and ensure the tweet stirs controversy, outrage, or intense debate. If the styles are right-leaning, the tweet should challenge left-leaning ideals; if left-leaning, it should provoke those with conservative views. Focus on divisive rhetoric that highlights differences in ideology, values, or beliefs, making the tweet impossible to ignore. Ensure it invites strong reactions â€” whether agreement or backlash. Keep it brief, edgy, and emotionally charged, and include the hashtag #${trend
      .split(" ")
      .join(
        ""
      )} to boost visibility. **Important:** Do not wrap the tweet in quotes or add any additional context. The output should be the tweet itself, crafted to go viral and polarize the audience.`;
